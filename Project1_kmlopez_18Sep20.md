Project Objectives
------------------

Vignettes are explanations of some concept, package, etc. with text,
code, and output interweaved.  
This project involves creating a vignette (a .md file that github will
render) about reading in data from an API, combining it, and exploring
it. You will then create a blog post linking to your vignette.

Repo
----

Rename the created file as README.md (notice this is .md not .Rmd! -
your outputted document should be a .md file) and use this as the README
for your repo. This should make the website for the repo correspond to
the output of your .Rmd file (essentially). Note: You can use the
`render` function to output to a specific file name rather than changing
it manually.

Blog
----

Once you’ve completed your vignette you should write a brief blog
post:  
• explaining what you did in the project and any findings you made  
• You should also reflect on the process you went through for this
project. Discuss things like:  
– what would you do differently in approaching the project?  
– what was the most difficult part of the logic and programming for
you?  
– what are your big take-aways for future projects?  
• In your blog post, provide a link to your github pages repo
